# Linea ENS

This repository contains smart contracts and a Node.js Gateway server that allow storing ENS names on Linea
using [EIP 3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668)
and [ENSIP 10](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution).
They have been adapted from ENS's [EVM gateway](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway)
and [ENS crosschain resolver](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-evmgateway/tree/master/crosschain-resolver)

It also contains a frontend adapted from [ENS's frontend](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-app-v3) to interact with the
deployed contract, to create and manage domains on Linea.

Thanks to ccip-read the domains created on Linea can also be resolved on Ethereum.

## CCIPRead process

![alt text](./media/LineaENSCCIPRead.png?raw=true)

This schema describes how a client application can resolve a domain name stored on Linea L2 from Ethereum L1 using CCIP
Read.

## Generic Usage

This repository focuses on the ENS use case but the gateway and Verifier contracts are generic, this means that they can
be reused for any other use cases
that need to fetch data stored on Linea from Ethereum in a trustless way.

The same Fetcher, Verifier contracts and gateway can be used without redeploying them.

To implement your own contract you simply need to:

1. Have your own contract extend `EVMFetcher` (In the Linea ENS case this is the L1Resolver contract).
2. In a view/pure context, use `EVMFetcher` to fetch the value of slots from another contract stored on Linea. Calling
   `EVMFetcher.fetch()` terminates execution and generates a callback to the same contract on a function you specify.
3. In the callback function, use the information from the relevant slots as you see fit.

## Example

The example below fetches another contract's storage value `testUint`.

```

import { EVMFetcher } from 'linea-state-verifier/EVMFetcher.sol';
import { EVMFetchTarget } from 'linea-state-verifier/EVMFetchTarget.sol';
import { IEVMVerifier } from 'linea-state-verifier/IEVMVerifier.sol';

contract TestL2 {
    uint256 testUint; // Slot 0

    constructor() {
        testUint = 42;
    }
}

contract TestL1 is EVMFetchTarget {
    using EVMFetcher for EVMFetcher.EVMFetchRequest;

    IEVMVerifier verifier;
    address target;

    uint256 constant ACCEPTED_L2_BLOCK_RANGE_LENGTH = 86400; // Can be changed to your accepted block range

    constructor(IEVMVerifier _verifier, address _target) {
        verifier = _verifier;
        target = _target;
    }

    /**
     * @dev inherits from EVMFetchTarget
     */
    function getAcceptedL2BlockRangeLength()
        public
        pure
        override
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return ACCEPTED_L2_BLOCK_RANGE_LENGTH;
    }

    function getTestUint() public view returns(uint256) {
        EVMFetcher.newFetchRequest(verifier, target)
            .getStatic(0)
            .fetch(this.getSingleStorageSlotCallback.selector, "");
    }

    function getSingleStorageSlotCallback(bytes[] memory values, bytes memory) public pure returns(uint256) {
        return uint256(bytes32(values[0]));
    }
}
```

## Installation

## Packages

### linea-ens-resolver

The linea-ens-resolver contract intented to be deployed on L1 that is built on top
of [linea-state-verifier](./packages/linea-state-verifier) and verifies Linea ENS data (domain names, metadata etc).

More documentation available in [linea-ens-resolver/README.md](./packages/linea-ens-resolver/README.md)

### linea-ens-contracts

The linea-ens-contracts contracts intented to be deployed on L2 (Linea) stores and returns the data necessary to resolve
a domain name and more data related to ENS.

More documentation available in [linea-ens-contracts/README.md](./packages/linea-ens-contracts/README.md)

### linea-ccip-gateway

A node-based gateway server that answers queries from L1 Gateway function calls relating to Linea-based L2 contracts.

### linea-ens-app

The Linea ENS frontend adapted from [ens-app-v3](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-app-v3)

### linea-ens-subgraph

The Linea ENS subgraph consumed by the frontend, adapted from [ens-subgraph](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-subgraph)

### linea-state-verifier

The linea state verifier contracts are responsible for checking values using sparse merkle proofs returned by the
linea-ccip-gateway for specific slots values stored on Linea, adapted
from [evm-verifier](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway/tree/main/evm-verifier)

### poh-signer-api

A NestJS API responsible for signing a message acknowledging an address has passed the POH process, the signature
created is then checked by the PohVerifier contract in the linea-ens-contracts.  
More information about POH in the package's readme.

## Deployed contracts

Check the deployment folders in [./packages/linea-ens-resolver/deployments](./packages/linea-ens-resolver/deployments)
and [./packages/linea-ens-contracts/deployments](./packages/linea-ens-contracts/deployments)

For detailed information about each package, please check their own Readme file.

## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome!

### Guidelines for Non-Code and other Trivial Contributions

Please keep in mind that we do not accept non-code contributions like fixing comments, typos or some other trivial
fixes. Although we appreciate the extra help, managing lots of these small contributions is unfeasible, and puts extra
pressure in our continuous delivery systems (running all tests, etc). Feel free to open an issue pointing to any of
those errors, and we will batch them into a single change.

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/issues)

   > If the proposed update is non-trivial, also tag us for discussion.

2. Submit the update as a pull request from your [fork of this repo](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/fork),
   and tag us for review.

   > Include the issue number in the pull request description and (optionally) in the branch name.
