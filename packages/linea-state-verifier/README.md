# linea-state-verifier

A Solidity library that verifies state proofs generated by a [linea-ccip-gateway](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/tree/main/packages/linea-ccip-gateway) instance. This library implements all the functionality required to make CCIP-Read calls to a linea-ccip-gateway and verify the responses, except for verifying the root of the proof. This library is intended to be used specifacilly to resolve any Linea storage state on L1.
It has been greatly inspired by the ENS [evm-gateway](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway/) but needed some custom changes to be compatible with Linea's proving system that uses SparseMerkleTree instead of the standard Patricia Merkle Tree.

For a detailed readme and usage instructions, see the [monorepo readme](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-ens/tree/main).
